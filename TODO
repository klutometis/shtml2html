* TODO should really make this a module so that the doctypes, etc.
  are available for internal shtml->html handling
* TODO library that exports xhtml roots (can't really use it, though,
  unless the documents themselve are quasiquoted
* TODO for efficiency's sake: could have ad-hoc executables for
  each doctype; no option parsing, no bifurcations
